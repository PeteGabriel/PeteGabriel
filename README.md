### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pedro, an everyday student with a big :heart: for software engineering and all things related.
I'm proficient with languages used for server-side systems like Java, C# and Javascript and on a personal level with Kotlin and Golang (:blue_heart:).

I like to keep up with new updates to the technologies I work with. I like to attend conferences, online courses, read about new technologies and developments and to make some experiments with it. 

Animals and specially horses :racehorse: are a very big passion of mine as well.
